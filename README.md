<p>Open the main folder with Vs Code</p>

<p>Then just use the <strong>"Live Server Extension"</strong>.</p>
<p>Install it from VS Code directly and you will be fine. </p>
<p>You'll then have a link in the bottom of your editor to start and run the server automatically and also view my HTML immediately.</p> <p>Or simply right-click in index.html file and click "Open with Live Server"</p>
